# Computational graph-based network models
This open-source aims to construct transportation network models using computational graphs and find optimal solutions based on the automatic differentiation algorithm (TensorFlow 2.0).

1) The computational graph-based recursive logit model is coded based on "Fosgerau, M., Frejinger, E. and Karlstrom, A., 2013. A link based network route choice model with unrestricted choice set. Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 56, pp.70-80."
